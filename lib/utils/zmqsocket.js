/*

This module contains modified zmq.Sockets.

Motivation:

The fire and forget zmq.Socket's OutBatch tactics does not fit our requirements.
On one hand we need to ensure deliverence of rpc packets (by repeating requests after timeout)
but when the peer on the other end of the socket dies we don't want to flood her with
queued requests when she comes back.

Both ZmqRpcSocket and ZmqProtocolSocket have different requirements but they have common ground in simplyfied
approach to sending, introduced in ZmqDealerSocket.

The other one is unnecessary argument spreading in 'message' event from zmq.Socket.

Also fixes a bug with pause.

  Sending:

  Unchanged

  Receiving:

  Instead of 'message' event the 'frames' event is emited with only one
  argument of type Array as received from zmq binding.

  Also fixes immediate pause issue. Original zmq.Socket.prototype.pause() may not be immediate, see:

  Sending:

  There are no out batches like in original zmq.Socket.

  The `send(msg) -> bool` method either pushes the message immediately to the zmq socket queue (returning true)
  or enables 'drain' events on self and returns false.
  User may try to send again on 'drain' event. Successfull send will disable 'drain' events.
  However user may also give up and disable 'drain' events calling cancelSend().

  Receiving: see ZmqSocket
